Forest Fire Detection using Deep Learning


Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect forest fires from images using deep learning. The goal is to enable early detection to help reduce the impact of forest fires on ecosystems, wildlife, and human life.

Objectives
Understand and implement CNNs using TensorFlow and Keras

Train a model to classify images as "fire" or "no fire"

Evaluate model performance using accuracy and loss

Predict fire presence in new, unseen images

Apply deep learning to address a real-world environmental problem

Tools and Technologies
Google Colab – for cloud-based model development and training

Python – programming language used for all implementation

TensorFlow and Keras – deep learning libraries used to build the CNN

NumPy – for handling numerical data

Matplotlib – for visualizing training results

ImageDataGenerator – for image preprocessing and augmentation

Methodology
Dataset Acquisition – Wildfire image dataset obtained from Kaggle

Data Exploration – Visualized sample images from 'fire' and 'no fire' classes

Data Preparation – Resized images to 150x150, normalized pixel values, and prepared train/validation/test sets

Model Building – Built a CNN with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers

Model Compilation – Used Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function

Model Training – Trained for 12 epochs and monitored accuracy and loss

Model Evaluation – Tested performance and visualized results

Prediction Function – Developed a utility to classify uploaded images

Results
The trained model successfully distinguishes between fire and non-fire images

Achieved high accuracy and demonstrated strong performance on test data

Accuracy and loss graphs show consistent training behavior

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how deep learning can be effectively used for forest fire detection. It highlights the practical application of CNNs in environmental protection and offers hands-on experience with data processing, model design, and evaluation.
